## 1. Introduction

Day 2 focuses on sequential RTL using D flip-flops, reset behavior, and hierarchical module organization. The examples compare asynchronous and synchronous reset implementations and show how hierarchy appears in a synthesized netlist.

## 2. Objective

- Understand how a D flip-flop stores data on a clock edge.
- Compare asynchronous and synchronous reset behavior.
- Organize RTL using multiple modules and submodules.
- Observe hierarchy before and after synthesis.

## 3. Design Description

The D flip-flop examples model state elements controlled by a clock and reset. The multiple-module examples demonstrate how a larger design can be built from reusable submodules.

## 4. Reset Behavior

An asynchronous reset can change the state independently of the clock, while a synchronous reset is sampled on the active clock edge. The waveform and reference images provide a visual comparison of these timing behaviors.

## 5. Hierarchy and Synthesis

The design hierarchy is represented through a top-level module and submodules. Synthesis can preserve or flatten this hierarchy when producing the implementation netlist, which is illustrated by the module and flattened-netlist references.

## 6. Results

- Asynchronous and synchronous reset timing are compared.
- The D flip-flop examples demonstrate clocked state storage.
- The hierarchical design is represented through multiple modules and a synthesized netlist.

## 7. Conclusion

This exercise builds the foundation for sequential RTL design and shows why reset semantics and module hierarchy matter during simulation and synthesis.
